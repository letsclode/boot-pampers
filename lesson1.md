Great! Let's dive into Lesson 1: Custom Hooks.

1. Introduction to Custom Hooks:

Custom hooks are functions that allow you to encapsulate and reuse component logic.
They are an essential tool to extract complex logic from components, making them more manageable and reusable.
Custom hooks follow the naming convention: useXYZ, where XYZ represents the functionality they provide.

2. Creating Custom Hooks:

Explain the process of creating a custom hook.
Start by creating a new file for the hook (e.g., useCounter.js).
Import the necessary dependencies (e.g., useState) and define the custom hook function.
Inside the hook, you can use any React hooks and logic required.

3. Example 1: State Management Custom Hook:

Build a simple custom hook called useCounter for managing a count state.
The custom hook should have functions for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the count.
Demonstrate how to use this custom hook in multiple components.

4. Example 2: Form Handling Custom Hook:

Create a custom hook called useForm for managing form state and validation.
The hook should handle form inputs, validation, and form submission.
Illustrate how this custom hook simplifies form handling in various forms across the application.

5. Example 3: API Call Custom Hook:

Develop a custom hook called useAPI for handling API calls.
The hook should handle data fetching, loading, and error states for API requests.
Demonstrate how this custom hook can be used in different components to fetch data from APIs.

6. Best Practices and Custom Hook Patterns:

Discuss best practices for creating custom hooks.
Emphasize the importance of making hooks reusable, composable, and easy to understand.
Show common patterns like using useEffect, useRef, and useCallback within custom hooks.
Mini-task:
Create a custom hook called useLocalStorage that manages data persistence in local storage. The hook should have functions to save and retrieve data from local storage. Use this custom hook in a simple counter application to persist the count between page reloads.

At the end of Lesson 1, students should understand the concept of custom hooks, be able to create their own hooks, and have practical examples of using custom hooks for various scenarios like state management, form handling, and API calls. The mini-task will reinforce their understanding and encourage them to build reusable custom hooks in their projects.
