**Lesson 5: Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**

In this lesson, we will focus on implementing pagination and infinite scrolling to enhance the user experience when dealing with large lists of data in a React application.

**1. Introduction to Pagination:**
   - Explaining the concept of pagination and its benefits in handling large data sets.
   - Implementing basic pagination with page numbers and "Next"/"Previous" buttons.

**2. Server-Side Pagination:**
   - Understanding server-side pagination and its advantages in performance and data efficiency.
   - Making API requests with query parameters to fetch specific pages of data.

**3. Client-Side Pagination:**
   - Implementing client-side pagination for scenarios where server-side pagination is not feasible.
   - Managing data locally and displaying only the relevant page of data.

**4. Introduction to Infinite Scrolling:**
   - Understanding infinite scrolling and how it differs from traditional pagination.
   - Explaining the benefits of infinite scrolling for a smoother user experience.

**5. Implementing Infinite Scrolling:**
   - Dynamically loading more data as the user scrolls down the page.
   - Using intersection observers or scroll event listeners to trigger data loading.

**6. Combining Pagination and Infinite Scrolling:**
   - Implementing a hybrid approach that combines both pagination and infinite scrolling for a flexible user experience.
   - Allowing users to switch between pagination and infinite scrolling based on their preferences.

**Mini-task:**
Implement pagination for a list of items fetched from an API. Allow users to navigate through different pages and observe the data load as they switch between pages.

**Final Project: Infinite Scroll Gallery:**
Challenge the campers to build an image gallery with infinite scrolling. Fetch images from an API and display them in a grid. As the user scrolls down, load more images dynamically to create a seamless infinite scroll experience. This project will allow campers to practice both pagination and infinite scrolling techniques in a real-world scenario.
