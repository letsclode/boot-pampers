**Lesson 4: Authentication and User Management**

In this lesson, we will focus on implementing user authentication using either Firebase or Auth0 in a React application. We will also cover managing user profiles and roles to control access to certain parts of the application.

**1. Introduction to User Authentication:**
   - Understanding the importance of user authentication in web applications.
   - Explaining different authentication methods, including email/password, social login, and single sign-on (SSO).

**2. Setting up Firebase Authentication:**
   - Creating a Firebase project and enabling Firebase Authentication.
   - Implementing user registration and login using Firebase email/password authentication.
   - Integrating Firebase authentication with React components.

**3. Setting up Auth0 Authentication:**
   - Signing up for an Auth0 account and creating an Auth0 application.
   - Configuring Auth0 to support email/password authentication and social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
   - Integrating Auth0 authentication with React components.

**4. Managing User Profiles:**
   - Storing user profiles and additional user data in Firebase or a custom database with Auth0.
   - Allowing users to update their profiles and account information.

**5. Role-based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Implementing role-based access control to manage user roles and permissions.
   - Defining roles (e.g., admin, user) and restricting access to specific routes or features based on roles.

**6. Handling Authentication State:**
   - Managing authentication state in the React application using React Context or Redux.
   - Redirecting users to appropriate routes based on authentication status.

**Mini-task:**
Create a simple user registration and login system using either Firebase or Auth0. Allow users to sign up with their email and password, and implement user login with appropriate error handling.

**Final Project: Secure Admin Panel:**
Challenge the campers to build a secure admin panel with role-based access control. The admin panel should require authentication, and only users with the "admin" role should have access. The admin should be able to perform specific tasks or manage data that regular users cannot access. This project will allow campers to demonstrate their understanding of user authentication, user management, and role-based access control concepts in a real-world application.
