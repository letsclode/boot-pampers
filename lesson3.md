**Lesson 3: Data Visualization**

In this lesson, we will introduce data visualization libraries like D3.js and Chart.js and explore how to build various data visualizations, including charts, graphs, and maps, in a React application.

**1. Introduction to Data Visualization Libraries:**
   - Overview of data visualization and its importance in understanding and presenting data effectively.
   - Introduction to popular data visualization libraries like D3.js and Chart.js.
   - Understanding the differences and use cases of each library.

**2. Getting Started with D3.js:**
   - Setting up D3.js in a React application using npm or yarn.
   - Understanding the basic concepts of D3.js, such as selections, data binding, and enter/update/exit pattern.
   - Building simple data visualizations, such as bar charts and line charts, with D3.js in a React component.

**3. Building Interactive Charts with Chart.js:**
   - Installing and importing Chart.js in a React application.
   - Creating different types of charts, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and radar charts, using Chart.js.
   - Enhancing the charts with customization, tooltips, and animations.

**4. Advanced Data Visualization with D3.js:**
   - Leveraging D3.js for more complex visualizations, including scatter plots, heatmaps, and hierarchical visualizations.
   - Implementing interactivity, such as zooming and panning, in D3.js visualizations.
   - Combining D3.js with other libraries like React-vis or Victory for specialized visualizations.

**5. Geo Data Visualization with D3.js and Maps with React-Leaflet:**
   - Visualizing geographical data with D3.js, including plotting data on maps.
   - Integrating React-Leaflet with D3.js to create interactive and responsive maps in a React application.
   - Adding custom markers, popups, and other map features.

**6. Data Visualization Best Practices:**
   - Understanding the importance of visual clarity and simplicity in data visualization.
   - Choosing appropriate chart types and color schemes for different data sets.
   - Implementing responsive designs for data visualizations to adapt to different screen sizes.

**Mini-task:**
Create a bar/any graph/chart using Chart.js or D3.js to visualize sample data. Enhance the chart with labels, tooltips, and animations for better user experience.

**Final Project: Interactive Dashboard:**
Challenge the campers to build an interactive data dashboard using data visualization libraries of their choice (D3.js, Chart.js, or a combination). The dashboard should include multiple visualizations representing different data sets and should offer interactive features like filtering, sorting, and zooming. This project will allow campers to showcase their data visualization skills and create a compelling and informative dashboard that presents data in an engaging way.
