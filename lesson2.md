**Lesson 2: Real-time Communication**

In this lesson, we will explore real-time communication techniques with React and learn how to build a real-time chat application using either WebSockets or Firebase.

**1. Real-time Communication with React:**
   - Introduction to real-time communication and its importance in modern web applications.
   - Exploring different real-time communication techniques, including WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and Firebase Realtime Database.

**2. WebSockets:**
   - Understanding WebSocket protocol and its bidirectional communication capabilities.
   - Implementing WebSockets in React using libraries like `socket.io-client`.
   - Building a basic real-time chat application with WebSocket for instant messaging.

**3. Firebase Realtime Database:**
   - Introduction to Firebase Realtime Database and its real-time synchronization capabilities.
   - Setting up a Firebase project and integrating it with a React application.
   - Building a real-time chat application using Firebase Realtime Database.

**4. Real-time Chat Application with WebSockets:**
   - Building a real-time chat application using WebSockets in React.
   - Creating a simple UI for sending and receiving messages.
   - Managing user authentication and handling multiple chat rooms.

**5. Real-time Chat Application with Firebase:**
   - Building a real-time chat application using Firebase Realtime Database in React.
   - Designing the chat UI and implementing user authentication with Firebase Authentication.
   - Configuring Firebase rules for secure data access.

**6. Handling Presence and Typing Indicators:**
   - Implementing presence system to display online/offline status of users.
   - Adding typing indicators to show when users are currently typing in a chat.

**7. Advanced Features:**
   - Adding file/image sharing capabilities in the chat.
   - Implementing message history and scroll-to-bottom functionality.
   - Supporting emojis and other rich text features.

**Mini-task:**
Create a simple real-time chat application using either WebSockets or Firebase. The application should allow users to send and receive messages in real-time, and the messages should be displayed instantly to all participants. Implement user authentication to identify users, and provide a clean and user-friendly interface.

**Final Project: Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard:**
For the final project, challenge the campers to build a real-time collaborative whiteboard using either WebSockets or Firebase. Multiple users should be able to draw on the whiteboard simultaneously, and their drawings should be visible to all other connected users in real-time. Users should also be able to chat with each other while collaborating on the whiteboard.

This final project will combine the concepts learned in the lesson and provide a hands-on experience with building a sophisticated real-time application. It will challenge the campers to utilize their knowledge of real-time communication techniques and React to create a dynamic and interactive collaborative experience.
